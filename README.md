# What is MOAI?

MOAI is a server and client side Minecraft mod that allows you to easily import and render Tabula models inside your Minecraft world! The simple UI allows you to easily position scale and rotate your model within the game.

## How do I use MOAI?

Both the client and server need to have the models installed in order to launch them. In order to install a model, simply place it in your server / clients models folder.

- For servers, this in your server base directory: mods/tabula/saved/. So for example: mods/tabula/saved/Example.tbl
- For client, this is in your .minecraft folder, located in %appdata% on Windows. Simply place it in .minecraft/mods/tabula/saved. So for example, .minecraft/mods/tabula/saved/Example.tbl

Next, launch the game. You will need the Moai Block found in the Decoration tab. Once you place the block, right click on it, and search for the model in the search bar. Then, you can change its side position and rotation. A description of each control can be seen below:
